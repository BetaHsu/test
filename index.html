    <h5>   Creator’s Note: </h5>
    <h5>   This game was created in April 2021, based on my feelings towards the absurd human nature trying to make sense of everything. </h5>
    <h5>   The writing is generated by hypertext via Twine2 and context-free grammar via RiTa, <br>which allows the game to generate different texts according to grammars defined.
      <br>Therefore, different outcomes might appear as the game is being run again and again. </h5>
