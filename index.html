    <h5>   Creator’s Note: </h5>
    <h4>   This game was created in April 2021, based on my feelings towards the absurd human nature trying to make sense of everything. </h4>
    
    <h4>   Several parts of the writing are generated by RiTa’s (a software toolkit for computational literature) RiScript scripting language, which allows the game to generate texts according to grammars defined.Therefore, different outcomes might appear as the game is being run again and again. </h4>
