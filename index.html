    <h3>Creator’s Note: </h3>
    <h4>This game was created in April 2021, based on my feelings towards </h4>
    <h4>the absurd human nature trying to make sense of everything. </h4>
    
    <h4>Several parts of the writing are generated by RiTa’s (a software toolkit for computational literature) </h4>
    <h4>RiScript scripting language, which allows the game to generate texts according to grammars defined. </h4>
    <h4>Therefore, different outcomes might appear as the game is being run again and again. </h4>
