    <h5>   Creator’s Note:  </h5>
    <p>   This game was created in April 2021, based on my feelings towards the absurd human nature trying to make sense of everything. </p>
    <p>
        The writing is generated by hypertext via Twine2 and context-free grammar via RiTa,
        which allows the game to generate different texts according to grammars defined.<br>
        Therefore, different outcomes might appear as the game is being run again and again.
